# Set the initial window size to a maximum size specified by WxH, without
# changing the window's aspect ratio. The size is measured in pixels, or if a
# number is followed by a percentage sign (%), in percents of the screen size.
#
# This option never changes the aspect ratio of the window. If the aspect ratio
# mismatches, the window's size is reduced until it fits into the specified
# size.
#
# Window position is not taken into account, nor is it modified by this option
# (the window manager still may place the window differently depending on
# size). Use --geometry to change the window position. Its effects are applied
# after this option.

# Create a video output window even if there is no video. This can be useful
# when pretending that mpv is a GUI application. Currently, the window always
# has the size 640x480, and is subject to --geometry, --autofit, and similar
# options.
#
# WARNING:
#    The window is created only after initialization (to make sure default
#    window placement still works if the video size is different from the
#    --force-window default window size). This can be a problem if
#    initialization doesn't work perfectly, such as when opening URLs with bad
#    network connection, or opening broken video files. The immediate mode can
#    be used to create the window always on program start, but this may cause
#    other issues.

# Load  the  embedded ICC profile contained in media files such as
# PNG images.  (Default: yes). Note that this  option  only  works
# when   also  using  a  display  ICC  profile  (--icc-profile  or

#use-embedded-icc-profile

###
# Load an ICC profile and use it to transform video RGB to  screen
# output.   Needs  LittleCMS  2  support  compiled in. This option
# overrides the --target-prim, --target-trc and --icc-profile-auto
# options.

###
# Automatically select the ICC display profile currently specified
# by the display settings of the operating system.
#
# NOTE: On Windows, the default profile must be  an  ICC  profile.
# WCS profiles are not supported.
#
# Applications  using  libmpv  with the render API need to provide
# the ICC profile via MPV_RENDER_PARAM_ICC_PROFILE.

###
# Store and load the 3D LUTs created from the ICC profile in  this
# directory.   This  can  be  used to speed up loading, since Lit‚Äê
# tleCMS 2 can take a while to create a 3D LUT.  Note  that  these
# files  contain  uncompressed  LUTs.  Their  size  depends on the
# --icc-3dlut-size, and can be very big.

# NOTE: This is not cleaned automatically, so  old,  unused  cache
# files may stick around indefinitely.

# Specify the sub font size. The unit is the size in scaled pixels

# well.

# Default: 55.
