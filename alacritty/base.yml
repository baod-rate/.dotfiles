# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: xterm-256color
  TERM: alacritty

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 0
    lines: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 2
    y: 2

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: full

  # When true, alacritty starts maximized.
  startup_mode: Windowed

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
  # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
  # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
  faux_multiplier: 3

  # Scroll to the bottom when new text is written to the terminal.
  auto_scroll: false

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
tabspaces: 8

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#font:
#   (cont in platform-specific config files)

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false

# Colors (Tomorrow Night Bright)
#colors:
# (cont in base16-colors.yml)

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo
#   - EaseOutCirc
#   - Linear
#
# Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.
visual_bell:
  animation: EaseOutExpo
  duration: 0
  # doesn't seem to have any effect?:
  color: '0xb8bb26'

# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
# The value `0.0` is completely transparent and `1.0` is opaque.
background_opacity: 1.0

# Mouse bindings
#
# Available fields:
#   - mouse
#   - action
#   - mods (optional)
#
# Values for `mouse`:
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# All available `mods` and `action` values are documented in the key binding
# section.
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

selection:
  semantic_escape_chars: ",│`|:\"' ()[]{}<>"

  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to the primary clipboard.

# Allow terminal applications to change Alacritty's window title.
dynamic_title: true

cursor:
  # Cursor style
  #
  # Values for `style`:
  #   - ▇ Block
  #   - _ Underline
  #   - | Beam

  # If this is `true`, the cursor will be rendered as a hollow box when the
  # window is not focused.
  unfocused_hollow: true

# Live config reload (changes require restart)
live_config_reload: true

# Windows 10 ConPTY backend (Windows only)
#
# This will enable better color support and may resolve other issues,
# however this API and its implementation is still young and so is
# disabled by default, as stability may not be as good as the winpty
# backend.
#
# Alacritty will fall back to the WinPTY automatically if the ConPTY
# backend cannot be initialized.
#enable_experimental_conpty_backend: false

# Send ESC (\x1b) before characters when alt is pressed.
